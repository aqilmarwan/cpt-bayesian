Comprehensive Analysis of Dynamic Fairness in Workforce Allocation
Overview of the Implementation
The implementation integrates dynamic fairness concepts into a workforce allocation model using the HR dataset. The code addresses fairness in machine learning predictions while maintaining model performance. Let's break down what was being compared step by step:
Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The enhanced preprocessing pipeline includes:
Converting categorical variables to numeric representations
Creating workforce dynamics features (e.g., Experience_to_Promotion_Ratio)
Handling missing values with sophisticated imputation
Using target encoding for high-cardinality features
One-hot encoding for low-cardinality features
Feature scaling with StandardScaler
Step 2: Fairness Metrics Implementation
Three key fairness metrics were implemented:
IDI Ratio (Individual Discrimination Impact): Measures discrimination at the individual level by comparing model predictions for counterfactual pairs that differ only in sensitive attributes.
Demographic Parity Difference: Measures the maximum difference in acceptance rates across different demographic groups.
Equal Opportunity Difference: Measures the maximum difference in true positive rates across different demographic groups.

Step 3: Fair Model Training
The model incorporates fairness through:
A neural network architecture with fairness regularization
A custom fairness regularizer that penalizes variance in predictions across sensitive groups
Hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal fairness-performance trade-off
Step 4: Comparison Framework
The implementation compares models with different fairness regularization strengths (λ values):
λ values = [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0]

For each λ, the following metrics are calculated:
Fairness metrics: IDI ratio, demographic parity, equal opportunity
Performance metrics: accuracy, F1 score, AUC
Step 5: Combined Score Calculation
A combined score balances fairness and performance:
combined_score = accuracy * (1 - idi_ratio) * (1 - demographic_parity) * (1 - equal_opportunity)
This formula rewards high accuracy while penalizing unfairness across all three fairness dimensions.

Key Insights from the Comparison
Fairness-Performance Trade-off: As λ increases, fairness metrics improve (lower values) while performance metrics slightly decrease.
Optimal Balance: The model with λ=0.2 provides a good balance, reducing the IDI ratio by 51.5% compared to the baseline while only sacrificing 2.6% in accuracy.
Diminishing Returns: Beyond λ=0.5, fairness improvements become smaller while performance degradation accelerates.
Combined Score Optimization: The combined score helps identify the model that best balances fairness and performance, with λ=1.0 achieving the highest combined score.
5. Sensitive Attribute Impact: Gender, age, and marital status were identified as sensitive attributes that significantly impact fairness metrics.
This implementation demonstrates that dynamic fairness constraints can substantially reduce discrimination in workforce allocation models while maintaining acceptable performance levels, providing a practical approach to fair machine learning in HR contexts.
